      <h2>User research</h2>
      <h4>Thirty-five people responded to a survey about cloud storage preferences.  Questions  I hoped to have answered:</h4>
      <p>What do users want and expect?</p>
      <p>Why don’t people use cloud storage?</p>
      <p>What would make non-users become users?<p/>
      <p>Do the user’s preferences align with the client’s proposal?</p>
      <p>The results</p>
      <p>Cloud storage users vs. Non-users</p>
      <p>70%</p>
      <p>Cloud storage users</p>
      <p>30%</p>
      <p>Cloud storage non-users</p>
      <p>The majority of respondents are college-educated men who travel to the city from the suburbs to work.</p>
      <p>Of those 70% using cloud storage ...</p>
      <p>Dropbox and Google Drive are most popular.</p>
      <p>Most are willing to pay for more space.</p>
      <p>Photos & video are most common uses.</p>
      <p>Of the 30% not using cloud storage ...</p>
      <p>Distrust the security or don't understand how the technology works.</p>
      <p>Storing photos and videos would be main reason.</p>

      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <img src="images/google-drive.png" alt="google drive">
      <h6>best case-scenario</h6>
      <h4>Google Drive</h4>
      <p>Google Drive and Google’s suite of apps uses the same basic process for content organization and creation as you would for your own computer or when using Word. Visually it’s well organized, clean and simple. It only uses flourishes when needed for emphasis or navigation.</p>
      <img src="images/evernote-logo.png" alt="evernote">
      <h6>Most realistic goal</h6>
      <h4>Evernote</h4>
      <p>Bin should do everything that Evernote does well, but Bin should be easier to use. Evernote does content organization and creation well, but lacks in collaboration features. Matching Evernote where it does well and expanding on work collaboration features should tempt users.</p>
      <img src="images/box-logo.png" alt="box">
      <h6>Baseline goal</h6>
      <h4>Box</h4>
      <p>It’s clean, simple and basic design is a good place to start for new services wanting to offer something to potential users who may not yet use cloud storage. It’s easy to store and organize content, but its content creation and work collaboration features are limited. </p>

      <p>Sketches</p>
      <p>First step was to sketch ideas for main sections of the app and website. I did four-up sketches for the landing page, onboarding, dashboard and text document creation. </p>
      <img src="images/wireframes-landing.jpg" alt="user flow">
      <img src="images/wireframes-dash.jpg" alt="user flow">
      <img src="images/wireframes-note.jpg" alt="user flow">
      <p>Wireframes</p>
      <p>Second step was to create digital wireframes from the sketches. Because I did four-up sketches, I took the best ideas from each sketch and put them together in the wireframes. </p>

      <img src="images/mockups-dash.jpg" alt="user flow">
      <img src="images/mockups-note.jpg" alt="user flow">
      <p>Mockups</p>
      <p>Once the wireframes were done, the third step was to build mockups of how the app and website would actually look based on the the basic structure and content of the wireframes. </p>

    <!-- preference testing section -->
    <section class="preference">
      <h2>Preference testing</h2>
      <h4>The prototype was tested by potential users. They were asked three questions and given two options. They chose which option they preferred.</h4>
      <p>1. Dark background or white background.</p>
      <p>The white background won by a slight margin. I think one way to address this is to give users the option to choose between a light or dark background. </p>
      <p> 2. Current rail color palette of green screen and purple buttons or the inverse.</p>
      <p>Two-thirds of those who responded replied that they prefer the rail as it is currently purple on green.</p>
      <p>3. Rounded corners or square corners. </p>
      <p>Round corners won by a slim margin of 55%, so because of the split I kept the round corners to tie in with the branding.</p>

      <img src="images/preftest-before.jpg" alt="user test before">
      <img src="images/preftest-after.jpg" alt="user test after">
      <p>One more check to make sure users had no issues getting signed up, logged in and were able to easily use the features proved successful. No users had issues with anything other than deciphering some iconography used to communicate a few actions. That prompted me to replace the icons with text.</p>

    <!-- conclusion section -->
    <section class="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This process from start to finish is challenging. If there was an error to be made, I probably made it in this project. The part that probably worked the best was the user research portions. I think I got some very educational feedback and if I had more time I would have tried to get more responses. I think in the future, I’ll try harder to test everything more. Do preference tests on more stuff and try to get more survey results. </p>
