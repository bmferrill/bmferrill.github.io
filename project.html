      <h2>User research</h2>
      <h4>Thirty-five people responded to a survey about cloud storage preferences.  Questions  I hoped to have answered:</h4>
      <p>What do users want and expect?</p>
      <p>Why don’t people use cloud storage?</p>
      <p>What would make non-users become users?<p/>
      <p>Do the user’s preferences align with the client’s proposal?</p>
      <p>The results</p>
      <p>Cloud storage users vs. Non-users</p>
      <p>70%</p>
      <p>Cloud storage users</p>
      <p>30%</p>
      <p>Cloud storage non-users</p>
      <p>The majority of respondents are college-educated men who travel to the city from the suburbs to work.</p>
      <p>Of those 70% using cloud storage ...</p>
      <p>Dropbox and Google Drive are most popular.</p>
      <p>Most are willing to pay for more space.</p>
      <p>Photos & video are most common uses.</p>
      <p>Of the 30% not using cloud storage ...</p>
      <p>Distrust the security or don't understand how the technology works.</p>
      <p>Storing photos and videos would be main reason.</p>

      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <img src="images/google-drive.png" alt="google drive">
      <h6>best case-scenario</h6>
      <h4>Google Drive</h4>
      <p>Google Drive and Google’s suite of apps uses the same basic process for content organization and creation as you would for your own computer or when using Word. Visually it’s well organized, clean and simple. It only uses flourishes when needed for emphasis or navigation.</p>
      <img src="images/evernote-logo.png" alt="evernote">
      <h6>Most realistic goal</h6>
      <h4>Evernote</h4>
      <p>Bin should do everything that Evernote does well, but Bin should be easier to use. Evernote does content organization and creation well, but lacks in collaboration features. Matching Evernote where it does well and expanding on work collaboration features should tempt users.</p>
      <img src="images/box-logo.png" alt="box">
      <h6>Baseline goal</h6>
      <h4>Box</h4>
      <p>It’s clean, simple and basic design is a good place to start for new services wanting to offer something to potential users who may not yet use cloud storage. It’s easy to store and organize content, but its content creation and work collaboration features are limited. </p>
